# Asteroseismology---Target-Selection
In a small group project, I was responsible for selecting an initial sample of stars from the PIC. This repository contains the code used to analyse a dataset of over 300,000 stars, supporting the selection and evaluation process. 

Asteroseismology probes stellar internal structure through the analysis of global oscillation modes. This project focuses on pressure modes (p-modes), which are stochastically excited by turbulent convection and restored by pressure forces, producing characteristic frequency spectra that encode information about stellar interiors.

The current analysis primarily targets Sun-like stars, for which p-mode oscillations have been most robustly detected and characterized. The code in this repository is designed to support large-scale analysis of stellar populations, enabling the identification and characterization of oscillatory behavior across extensive datasets.

The scope of this work will be expanded in later phases of the project, informed by feedback from the data simulation and data analysis teams, to incorporate broader stellar classes and refined modeling approaches.
